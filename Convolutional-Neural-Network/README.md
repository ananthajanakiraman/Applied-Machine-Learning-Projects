**MNIST**

The MNIST dataset is a dataset of 60,000 training and 10,000 test examples of handwritten digits, originally constructed by Yann Lecun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. It is very widely used to check several methods. There are 10 classes in total ("0" to "9"). This dataset has been extensively studied, and there is a history of methods and feature constructions at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database and at the original site, http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. Please note that the best methods perform extremely well.
