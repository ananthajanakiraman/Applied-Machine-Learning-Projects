**Datasets**

**MNIST**

The MNIST dataset is a dataset of 60,000 training and 10,000 test examples of handwritten digits, originally constructed by Yann Lecun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges. It is very widely used to check several methods. There are 10 classes in total ("0" to "9"). This dataset has been extensively studied, and there is a history of methods and feature constructions at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database and at the original site, http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. Please note that the best methods perform extremely well.

**CIFAR-10**

CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 32x32 images in 10 categories, collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton. It is often used to evaluate machine learning algorithms. It can be downloaded from https:// www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html.

The dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.

The label classes in the dataset are:

+ airplane
+ automobile
+ bird
+ cat
+ deer
+ dog
+ frog
+ horse
+ ship
+ truck

The classes are completely mutually exclusive. There is no overlap between automobiles and trucks. "Automobile" includes sedans, SUVs, things of that sort. "Truck" includes only big trucks. Neither includes pickup trucks.
