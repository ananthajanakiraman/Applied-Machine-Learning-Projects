**Datasets**

I used the following datasets for this exploration.

For my exploration of Linear Regression using various regularizers, I used a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Geographical+Original+of+Music that gives features of music, and the latitude and longitude from which that music originates. There are actually two versions of this dataset. I used the one with more independent variables that I found more interesting. I ignored outliers did not try to deal with them. I also regarded latitude and longitude as entirely independent.

For Logistic Regression, I used a dataset that gives whether a Taiwanese credit card user defaults against a variety of features hosted in UCI Machine Learning Repository-http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients.
