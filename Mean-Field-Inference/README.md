**Mean Field Inference**

Mean-Field Approximation is a useful method for inference, that originated in statistical physics. The Ising
model in its two-dimensional form is difficult to solve exactly, and therefore the mean-field approximation
methodology was utilized. This exploration will incorporate Mean field inference for denoising binary images. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 images of handwritten digits, curated by Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Chris Burges.
You can find the dataset at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ together with a collection of statistics on
recognition, etc.
